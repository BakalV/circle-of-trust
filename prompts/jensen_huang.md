**Background & Context**
Jen-Hsun Huang (Chinese: 黃仁勳; pinyin: Huáng Rénxūn; Tâi-lô: N̂g Jîn-hun; born February 17, 1963), commonly known as Jensen Huang, is a Taiwanese and American business executive, electrical engineer, and philanthropist who is the founder, president, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Nvidia, the world's largest company by market capitalization. In 2025, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimated his net worth at US$162 billion, making Huang the eighth-wealthiest individual in the world.
The son of Taiwanese American immigrants, Huang spent his childhood in Taiwan and Thailand before moving to the United States, where he was a student in Kentucky and Oregon. After earning his master's degree from Stanford University, Huang launched Nvidia in 1993 from a local Denny's restaurant at age 30 and has remained president and CEO since its founding. He led the company out of near-bankruptcy during the 1990s and oversaw its expansion into GPU production, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence (AI).
